# Chapter 9: Measuring Your Agent Readiness

**The INPACT™ Assessment Chapter — Your Diagnostic Starting Point**

---

*Chapter 8 showed Echo's transformation in action—the Architecture of Trust delivering real results across real weeks. Now it's your turn. Echo Health Systems scored 28 out of 100. That single number revealed everything: why their agents failed, which infrastructure gaps blocked them, and exactly where to invest their $1.23M transformation budget. This chapter gives you the same diagnostic power—36 questions that measure your readiness across all three pillars of the Architecture of Trust. In 30 minutes, you'll know your score. In the chapters that follow, you'll build your custom roadmap to fix it.*

## Part 1: Assessment Methodology

### 1.1 Why One Assessment Works

Every enterprise attempting AI agent deployment faces the same question: Where do we start? The landscape seems overwhelming—infrastructure gaps, governance requirements, operational concerns, technology choices. Many organizations commission multiple assessments, hire different consultants for each layer, and end up with contradictory recommendations that consume months before any real work begins.

There's a simpler path. A single assessment can measure everything that matters.

The Architecture of Trust integrates three frameworks into one coherent system. Understanding this integration reveals why one assessment delivers comprehensive insight:

**INPACT™ defines what agents need.** Six dimensions capture the fundamental requirements any AI agent must have to operate reliably in an enterprise environment:

- **Instant**: Sub-second responses that match conversational speed
- **Natural**: Business language understanding without technical translation
- **Permitted**: Dynamic authorization respecting context, role, and purpose
- **Adaptive**: Continuous learning from feedback and changing conditions
- **Contextual**: Unified knowledge synthesis across all enterprise systems
- **Transparent**: Explainable decisions with traceable reasoning

**The 7-Layer Architecture delivers those needs.** Each layer addresses specific INPACT™ dimensions:

| Layer | Name | Primary INPACT™ Dimensions |
|-------|------|----------------------------|
| L1 | Multi-Modal Storage | I (speed), C (integration), N (vectors) |
| L2 | Real-Time Data Fabric | I (freshness), C (CDC), A (streaming) |
| L3 | Unified Semantic Layer | N (language), C (context), T (definitions) |
| L4 | Intelligent Retrieval | N (RAG), A (learning), C (synthesis) |
| L5 | Agent-Aware Governance | P (ABAC), T (audit), G (compliance) |
| L6 | Observability & Feedback | T (traces), A (feedback), O (monitoring) |
| L7 | Multi-Agent Orchestration | All dimensions coordinated |

**GOALS™ ensures sustainable operation.** Five operational targets—Governance, Observability, Availability, Lexicon, and Solid—translate infrastructure capability into organizational outcomes. *For complete GOALS™ framework detail, see Chapter 7.*

These three frameworks form a chain of dependency. INPACT™ requirements drive architecture decisions. Architecture capabilities enable operational excellence. Operational excellence delivers the trust that makes agent adoption successful.

    style Copyright fill:#ffffff,stroke:none,color:#666666
```

The integration principle is simple: **if you assess INPACT™ comprehensively, you've assessed everything.**

When you measure whether your infrastructure delivers *Instant* responses, you're simultaneously assessing Layer 1 (storage performance), Layer 2 (data freshness), and Layer 4 (caching efficiency). When you evaluate *Permitted* access control, you're measuring Layer 5 (governance) and Layer 6 (audit trails). Every INPACT™ dimension maps to specific layers and indicates GOALS™ readiness.

This is why 36 questions can measure your entire agent readiness posture. Not because the assessment is shallow, but because the questions target root causes that ripple through the entire system.

**What This Chapter Gives You:**

By the end of this chapter, you will have:

1. **Your INPACT™ score (0-100)**: A single number capturing your current agent readiness
2. **Dimension-by-dimension breakdown**: Which of the six needs your infrastructure fulfills and which remain gaps
3. **Layer priorities**: Which of the seven architecture layers need the most investment
4. **Timeline guidance**: How long your transformation will take based on your starting point
5. **Benchmark comparison**: How your journey compares to Echo Health Systems' 28→89 progression

The assessment takes approximately 30 minutes. The clarity it provides saves months of misdirected effort.

### 1.2 INPACT™ Scoring Methodology

The INPACT™ scoring system provides a standardized, repeatable method for measuring agent readiness. Every organization—regardless of industry, size, or current technology stack—can apply the same scale and achieve comparable results.

**Scoring Scale (1-6 per dimension)**

Each INPACT™ dimension is scored on a six-point scale:

| Score | Label | Description | Infrastructure State |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **6** | Excellent | Best-in-class, competitive advantage | Production-grade, exceeds requirements |
| **5** | Strong | Production-ready, meets all requirements | Full deployment appropriate |
| **4** | Functional | Adequate for limited production | Deploy with monitoring |
| **3** | Moderate | Basic capability, improvement needed | Pilot-only acceptable |
| **2** | Significant Gap | Poor capability, major gaps | Not deployment-ready |
| **1** | Critical Gap | Inadequate, blocks production | Immediate remediation required |

This scale captures meaningful distinctions. The difference between a 3 and a 4 isn't arbitrary—it represents the threshold between pilot-only capability and production deployment. The difference between a 5 and a 6 distinguishes meeting requirements from achieving competitive advantage.

**Calculation Method**

The INPACT™ score calculation is deliberately straightforward:

1. **Score each dimension**: Rate your infrastructure 1-6 on each of the six dimensions (I, N, P, A, C, T)
2. **Sum the raw scores**: Total = I + N + P + A + C + T (range: 6-36)
3. **Calculate percentage**: INPACT™ Score = (Total ÷ 36) × 100

For example, Echo Health Systems' Week 0 assessment:
- I (Instant): 1
- N (Natural): 2
- P (Permitted): 1
- A (Adaptive): 2
- C (Contextual): 3
- T (Transparent): 1
- **Total: 10 ÷ 36 = 28/100**

**Trust Bands**

Raw scores translate into five trust bands that indicate agent readiness:

```

| Raw Score | Percentage | Trust Band | Agent Readiness |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 31-36 | 86-100% | 🟢 **High Trust** | Production-ready for patient-facing agents |
| 24-30 | 67-83% | 🟡 **Good Trust** | Pilot-ready, minor gaps remain |
| 18-23 | 50-67% | 🟠 **Moderate Trust** | Significant work needed before agents |
| 12-17 | 33-50% | 🔴 **Low Trust** | Major transformation required |
| 6-11 | 17-33% | ⚫ **Very Low Trust** | Complete rebuild required |

These thresholds aren't arbitrary. They emerge from pattern recognition across 40+ enterprise implementations. Organizations scoring below 80/100 consistently experience agent failures in production. Those scoring 86+ achieve successful deployment with minimal post-launch issues.

*See Part 4 for detailed guidance on what your trust band means for timeline, budget, and chapter navigation.*

### 1.3 How INPACT™ Assesses the 7-Layer Architecture

The elegance of INPACT™ lies in its architecture coverage. Each dimension doesn't exist in isolation—it requires specific infrastructure layers to be fulfilled. When you score an INPACT™ dimension, you're simultaneously assessing the health of those underlying layers.

**Diagram: INPACT™ Dimension to Layer Mapping**

```

**The Mapping Principle**

Every INPACT™ dimension draws upon specific architectural capabilities:

| INPACT™ | Primary Layers | What's Actually Measured |
|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **I - Instant** | L1 (Storage), L2 (Real-Time), L4 (Cache) | Query execution speed, data pipeline latency, semantic caching effectiveness |
| **N - Natural** | L3 (Semantic), L4 (RAG), L1 (Vector) | NLU accuracy, business glossary coverage, embedding quality |
| **P - Permitted** | L5 (Governance), L6 (Observability) | ABAC policy coverage, HITL workflows, audit trail completeness |
| **A - Adaptive** | L4 (Intelligence), L6 (Feedback), L2 (Streaming) | Feedback loop latency, retraining automation, drift detection |
| **C - Contextual** | L1-L3 (Integration), L2 (CDC), L4 (RAG) | System integration count, CDC freshness, cross-domain entity resolution |
| **T - Transparent** | L6 (Observability), L5 (Governance) | Trace coverage, citation accuracy, explainability API availability |

**Coverage Verification**: This mapping touches all seven layers. L7 (Orchestration) emerges when multiple dimensions reach production thresholds simultaneously.

**Practical Implications**

When you complete the 36-question assessment and discover a low score in a particular dimension, you immediately know which layers require investment. Low I scores indicate foundation layer gaps (L1, L2). Low N scores point to intelligence layer bottlenecks (L3, L4). Low P and T scores reveal governance gaps (L5, L6). *See Part 4, Section 4.2 for the complete gap prioritization matrix mapping dimensions to Chapter 10 phases.*

### 1.4 How INPACT™ Indicates GOALS™ Readiness

The INPACT™ assessment measures infrastructure readiness—can you *build* agents? The GOALS™ framework measures operational readiness—can you *run* agents? These are different questions, but they're connected.

High INPACT™ scores indicate GOALS™ potential. If your infrastructure fulfills agent needs, you have the foundation for operational excellence. Low INPACT™ scores signal GOALS™ challenges ahead.

**The Distinction**

- **INPACT™** = Infrastructure capability (technical foundation)
- **GOALS™** = Operational capability (organizational execution)

You can have excellent infrastructure (INPACT™ 85+) and still struggle with operations if governance processes aren't defined, teams aren't trained, or observability dashboards aren't monitored. Conversely, you cannot achieve operational excellence without the infrastructure to support it.

**INPACT™ → GOALS™ Indicators**

| INPACT™ Dimension | GOALS™ Indicator | The Connection |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **P - Permitted** | G - Governance | ABAC policies, HITL workflows, and compliance controls constitute your governance capability |
| **T - Transparent** | O - Observability | Audit trails, trace infrastructure, and monitoring dashboards enable organizational visibility |
| **I - Instant** | A - Availability | Response time and uptime directly determine whether users can access agent capabilities |
| **N - Natural** | L - Language | Semantic accuracy and NLU quality define whether users and agents speak the same language |
| **A + C + T** | S - Solid | Learning, context, and transparency combine to ensure reliable, trustworthy output |

**Important Clarification**

This mapping is *indicative*, not deterministic. A score of P:5/6 means your governance *foundation* is strong—but operational governance requires policies, procedures, training, and accountability structures that go beyond infrastructure.

Chapter 8 detailed Echo's GOALS™ journey. Chapter 12 provides the operational playbook. This assessment identifies whether your infrastructure can support operational excellence; the chapters that follow show how to achieve it.

**Practical Application**

Use this mapping to anticipate operational challenges:

- **P:5/6** → Your G (Governance) foundation is strong. Governance processes can focus on policy definition rather than infrastructure gaps.
- **T:2/6** → Your O (Observability) will struggle. Without trace infrastructure, observability dashboards have nothing to display.
- **I:3/6** → Your A (Availability) SLAs are at risk. Users will experience delays that undermine adoption.

This foresight prevents surprises. If you know your T dimension is weak, you won't be blindsided when the observability team reports they can't build meaningful dashboards.

### 2.2 The 36 INPACT™ Questions

The assessment comprises six questions per dimension, covering the complete spectrum of agent infrastructure needs. Answer based on your *current* state—not planned improvements, not best-case scenarios, not what one team has achieved. Score your organization-wide reality.

---

#### Dimension 1: I — Instant (Speed Builds Confidence)

Agents operating at conversational speed require infrastructure that responds in milliseconds, not minutes. Users abandon slow agents. Trust erodes with every delay.

**I.1: Response Time Capability**

| 1 | No performance monitoring |

**I Dimension Total: ___ / 36** → **I Score: ___ / 6** (divide by 6)

---

#### Dimension 2: N — Natural (Understanding Builds Connection)

Agents must understand business language without requiring users to learn SQL, know table names, or translate concepts. The semantic layer bridges human intent and data reality.

**N.1: Semantic Layer Existence**

*Do you have a semantic layer that translates business terms to data structures?*

**N Dimension Total: ___ / 36** → **N Score: ___ / 6** (divide by 6)

---

### 2.3 How to Answer Honestly

The assessment's value depends entirely on honest answers. Inflated scores produce incorrect priorities and wasted investment. Accurate scores—even painful ones—lead to effective roadmaps.

**Common Scoring Traps**

- **Aspirational scoring**: "We're planning to implement real-time CDC next quarter." Score your *current* state, not your roadmap. If CDC isn't operational today, it doesn't count.

- **Best-case scoring**: "On a good day, we hit sub-2-second response times." Score your *typical* performance, not peak performance. If most queries take 5+ seconds, score accordingly.

- **Departmental scoring**: "Our data science team has a great semantic layer." Score your *organization-wide* capability. If the semantic layer serves one team but not the agents, it doesn't fulfill the need.

- **Technology-possession scoring**: "We own Databricks." Owning technology isn't the same as operational capability. Score based on what's working, not what's licensed.

**Honest Assessment Tips**

1. **Score what EXISTS today**, not what's planned, budgeted, or promised
2. **Get multiple perspectives**—data engineers, operations staff, and business users often see different realities
3. **Use evidence**: If you claim a score of 5, can you prove it with metrics?
4. **When uncertain, score lower**—conservative scores lead to appropriate investment, not over-engineering
5. **Revisit quarterly**—your score should improve as infrastructure matures

**The Value of Honesty**

Echo Health Systems scored 28/100 on their initial assessment. That number was painful to accept. Their CTO, Sarah Chen, later reflected: "Twenty-eight felt like failure. But it was the most valuable number we'd ever seen. It told us exactly where to invest. Every dollar we spent addressed a real gap, not a perceived one."

An inflated score of 50/100 would have led Echo to skip foundational work. They would have attempted intelligence layers on unstable foundations. The agents would have failed, and the failure would have been blamed on AI—not infrastructure.

Accurate scores lead to accurate roadmaps. Accurate roadmaps lead to successful agents.

Your INPACT™ score gains meaning through comparison. Echo Health Systems' transformation from 28/100 to 89/100 provides the definitive benchmark—a real progression through real infrastructure challenges with real investment decisions.

This section establishes Echo's journey as your reference point. Whether you're starting higher or lower, Echo's experience illuminates what each score means in practice.

---

### 3.1 Echo's Starting Point: 28/100

Echo Health Systems approached their initial assessment with confidence. Four hospitals, 23 clinics, 847 physicians, 340,000 annual patient encounters—they had data. They had technology. They had a board mandate to deploy AI agents.

They scored 28 out of 100.

**Echo's Week 0 Assessment — Dimension Breakdown**

| Dimension | Score | Evidence | Primary Layer Gap |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **I - Instant** | 1/6 | 47-second average query response, overnight batch ETL, no caching | L1, L2 critical gaps |
| **N - Natural** | 2/6 | 23% NLU accuracy, SQL required for complex queries, incomplete glossary | L3, L4 critical gaps |
| **P - Permitted** | 1/6 | Static RBAC only, shared service accounts, no HITL, audit shows "agent accessed" with no user identity | L5 missing entirely |
| **A - Adaptive** | 2/6 | No feedback loops, annual model refresh, no drift detection | L6 missing |
| **C - Contextual** | 3/6 | 5 systems connected, but 72-hour sync lag, basic entity resolution | L2 needs work |
| **T - Transparent** | 1/6 | Database query logs only, no reasoning visibility, cannot explain decisions | L5, L6 missing |
| **Raw Total** | **10/36** | | |
| **INPACT™ Score** | **28/100** | **Very Low Trust** | Complete rebuild required |

Sarah Chen, Echo's CTO, remembers the moment: "Twenty-eight out of a hundred. We're not ready for AI agents—we're barely ready for the questions."

**What 28/100 Revealed**

The score exposed three critical realities: five dimensions at critical gaps (1-2), only C (Contextual) showed any strength at 3/6, and all seven layers needed investment. At 28/100, Echo needed the full 90-day transformation with no shortcuts—the sequence of Foundation → Intelligence → Trust mattered.

The assessment delivered painful but clarifying truth that saved months of misdirected effort.

### 3.3 Using Echo as Your Benchmark

Echo's journey provides calibration for your own assessment.

**If Your Score Matches Echo's Week 0 (25-35)**

You face a complete transformation. You need:
- Full 90-day roadmap (Chapter 10)
- All four phases: Foundation → Intelligence → Trust → Operations
- Timeline: 10-12 weeks minimum to production readiness

**If Your Score Exceeds Echo's Week 4 (40-65)**

You have foundations in place. Your transformation compresses:
- Skip or abbreviate Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Focus on your weakest dimensions
- Timeline: 6-10 weeks to production readiness

**If Your Score Exceeds Echo's Week 7 (65-80)**

You're close to production readiness:
- Focus on dimensions scoring 3-4
- Governance and transparency often remain as final gaps
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks to production readiness

**If Your Score Falls Below Echo's Week 0 (<25)**

Consider extended timeline (16+ weeks), AIXcelerator acceleration, or phased approach to achieve pilot readiness first.

*For complete budget guidance by score range, see Chapter 10, Part 1 and Chapter 11, Section 1.4.*

### 4.1 What Your Score Means

Your trust band determines your transformation scope. Each band carries distinct implications for timeline, investment, and focus.

**🟢 High Trust (86-100%)**

You're production-ready or nearly so. Your infrastructure fulfills agent needs across all six dimensions.

- **Focus**: Operational excellence, continuous improvement, scaling
- **Primary chapters**: Chapter 12 (Running Agents at Scale)
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks to full production

Organizations in this band often arrived through prior modernization efforts. The INPACT™ assessment confirms readiness rather than revealing gaps.

**🟡 Good Trust (67-83%)**

Solid foundations with gaps in specific dimensions. Production deployment is achievable with targeted investment.

- **Focus**: Trust layers (L5-L7), specific dimension weaknesses
- **Primary chapters**: Chapters 10-11 for gap-specific guidance
- **Timeline**: 4-8 weeks to production

Most organizations in this band underestimate P and T dimensions. Address governance and transparency early—they become blockers at deployment.

**🟠 Moderate Trust (50-67%)**

Significant work spans multiple layers. You have capabilities but lack the integration and completeness agents require.

- **Focus**: Intelligence layers (L3-L4) plus trust layers (L5-L6)
- **Primary chapters**: Follow Chapters 10-11 closely
- **Timeline**: 8-12 weeks to production

Organizations in this band often have good data infrastructure but lack semantic and governance layers. The temptation is to deploy agents on existing infrastructure and "add governance later"—this produces pilot failures.

**🔴 Low Trust (33-50%)**

Major transformation required across most layers. Your infrastructure was built for a different era—BI reports, analyst queries, batch processing.

- **Focus**: All layers systematically, starting with foundations
- **Primary chapters**: Complete Chapter 10 roadmap, Chapter 11 for technology selection
- **Timeline**: 12-16 weeks

Echo started in this band at 28/100. Their journey proves transformation is achievable, but it requires commitment. *See Chapter 10 for complete phase-by-phase guidance and budget detail.*

**⚫ Very Low Trust (<33%)**

Complete rebuild required. Current infrastructure cannot support agent workloads without fundamental reconstruction.

- **Focus**: Establish foundations before anything else
- **Consider**: AIXcelerator acceleration (Chapter 12) to compress timeline
- **Timeline**: 16+ weeks

Organizations in this band face a choice: invest in systematic transformation or accept that agents will fail. *See Chapters 10-11 for complete investment guidance.*

| If Your Lowest Dimension Is... | Priority Layers | Chapter 10 Phase |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **I (Instant)** | L1, L2 | Phase 1: Foundation |
| **N (Natural)** | L3, L4 | Phase 2: Intelligence |
| **P (Permitted)** | L5 | Phase 3: Trust |
| **A (Adaptive)** | L4, L6 | Phase 3-4 |
| **C (Contextual)** | L1, L2, L3 | Phase 1-2 |
| **T (Transparent)** | L5, L6 | Phase 3 |

*For detailed INPACT™-to-Layer mapping with technology recommendations, see Chapter 11, Section 1.1.*

**Interpreting Multiple Low Dimensions**

If several dimensions score 1-2, prioritize based on dependencies: I and C first (foundational), N second (builds on data), P and T third (enable deployment), A fourth (can mature during production).

**Your Action Plan**

1. Record your six dimension scores
2. Identify your two lowest dimensions
3. Map those dimensions to priority layers (table above)
4. Proceed to Chapter 10 with clear focus

## Bridge to Chapter 10

You now have your INPACT™ score and know which dimensions need work. You understand how Echo progressed from 28/100 to 89/100 and where your journey fits that benchmark.

Chapter 10 translates your score into a week-by-week implementation plan. Whether you're starting at 28/100 like Echo or entering at 60/100 with partial infrastructure already in place, Chapter 10 customizes the 90-day roadmap to your starting point.

Your assessment revealed the gaps. The roadmap shows how to close them.
