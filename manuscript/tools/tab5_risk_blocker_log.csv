Risk ID,Week Identified,Risk Description,Probability,Impact,Severity,Status,Owner,Mitigation Plan,Week Mitigated,Outcome,Lessons Learned
R001,Week 1,Data quality baseline unknown - can't establish GOALS Soundness targets,High,High,🔴 Critical,✅ Resolved,Data Engineering Lead,"Deploy Great Expectations for 10 critical tables, run quality profiling for 1 week to establish baseline",Week 2,"Baseline established: 92% accuracy, 89% completeness, identified 3 critical quality issues requiring fixes",Always establish quality baseline Week 1 - can't improve what you don't measure
R002,Week 2,Dashboard adoption low - team not using observability tools,Medium,Medium,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,Engineering Manager,"Mandatory dashboard review in daily standups, train team on Grafana, create personalized views for each role",Week 3,"Adoption increased from 30% → 85%, early detection of 2 issues prevented escalation",Build observability into team rituals - don't make it optional
R003,Week 3,CDC complexity for legacy EHR - vendor API limitations,High,High,🔴 Critical,✅ Resolved,Data Engineering Lead,"Use Debezium database-level CDC instead of API-based, required DBA support for replication setup",Week 4,"CDC operational but 2 days late, <30s freshness achieved, stable for 8 weeks",Legacy systems need CDC at database level - APIs too slow/unreliable
R004,Week 4,Business glossary incomplete - domain experts too busy,Medium,High,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,Product Manager,"Dedicated 2-hour workshop sessions with each domain expert, incentivize participation with executive visibility",Week 5,"50 terms defined with expert validation, entity resolution improved from 68% → 82%",Engage domain experts early with time-boxed commitments - don't rely on async
R005,Week 5,Vector DB performance tuning - initial latency 120ms (target <50ms),Medium,High,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,ML Engineering Lead,"Optimize index parameters (m=16, ef_construction=200), reduce embedding dimensions 1536 → 768, add caching",Week 6,"Latency reduced to 42ms p95, throughput 10K/sec, 99.9% uptime maintained",Performance tune early - don't wait until production
R006,Week 6,RAG accuracy below target - initial 72% (target 85%),High,High,🔴 Critical,✅ Resolved,ML Engineering Lead,"Add Cohere reranking stage, tune retrieval top_k from 5 → 10, implement hybrid search (BM25 + vector)",Week 7,"Accuracy improved 72% → 85%, hybrid search +18% precision, NDCG@5: 0.71 → 0.84",Multi-stage RAG essential for production quality - single-stage insufficient
R007,Week 7,Agent accuracy plateau - not improving Week 6 → Week 7,Medium,Medium,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,ML Engineering Lead,"Analyze failure cases, improve prompt engineering, add few-shot examples for edge cases, semantic caching",Week 8,"Accuracy improved 85% → 87% with semantic caching (62% hit rate), reduced latency 20%",Semantic caching improves both accuracy and latency - implement early
R008,Week 8,ABAC policy complexity - 25 policies created vs 15 planned,Low,Medium,🟢 Low,✅ Resolved,Security Lead,"Simplify policies by consolidating similar rules, create policy templates for common patterns, document decisions",Week 9,"Reduced to 15 policies covering all use cases, <8ms evaluation maintained, easier to audit",Start simple with ABAC - add complexity only when needed
R009,Week 9,Human review queue overwhelming - 22% escalation rate (target <15%),High,High,🔴 Critical,✅ Resolved,Product Manager,"Adjust confidence threshold 75% → 80%, add auto-approve for low-risk cases (<$100), train 2 additional reviewers",Week 10,"Escalation rate reduced 22% → 12%, average review time 3min → 1.5min, queue backlog cleared",Tune HITL confidence thresholds empirically - start conservative then optimize
R010,Week 10,Feedback loop not improving agent - override rate flat,Medium,High,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,ML Engineering Lead,"Structure feedback capture (categorical labels), implement weekly retraining pipeline, collect 100+ corrections",Week 11,"Override rate decreased 12% → 7.8%, accuracy improved 87% → 89% from 127 corrections",Feedback requires structure - free text corrections don't improve models
R011,Week 11,Multi-agent coordination failures - 8% task failure rate,Medium,Medium,🟡 Medium,✅ Resolved,ML Engineering Lead,"Implement supervisor agent pattern, add retry logic with exponential backoff, conflict resolution rules",Week 12,"Task failure rate 8% → 2%, parallel execution maintained <3s latency, supervision overhead <200ms",Multi-agent systems need orchestration - don't rely on direct agent-to-agent communication
R012,Week 12,UAT findings require rework - 11 medium-priority issues,Medium,Medium,🟡 Medium,⏳ In Progress,Product Manager,"Prioritize top 5 issues for Week 12 fix, defer 6 lower-priority items to post-launch iteration, retest Week 13",Week 13 (extended),"5 critical issues fixed, UAT re-test 94% → 98% success, 6 items in production backlog for Month 2",Perfect is enemy of good - ship with known minor issues if core functionality solid
