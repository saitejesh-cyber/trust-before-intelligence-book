- **EHR:** Electronic Health Record — A digital version of a patient's medical history maintained by healthcare providers, including diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, and test results.

- **ETL:** Extract, Transform, Load — A data integration process that extracts data from source systems, transforms it into a consistent format, and loads it into a target system (typically a data warehouse).

- **FHIR:** Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources — A standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically, developed by HL7 International.

- **GenAI:** Generative Artificial Intelligence — AI systems capable of generating new content (text, images, code) based on patterns learned from training data.

- **GPT:** Generative Pre-trained Transformer — A type of large language model architecture developed by OpenAI, trained on vast text datasets to generate human-like text.

- **HNSW:** Hierarchical Navigable Small World — A graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search, commonly used in vector databases for efficient similarity search.

- **HIPAA:** Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — U.S. legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information.

- **HITL:** Human-in-the-Loop — A design pattern where human oversight is integrated into automated decision-making processes, typically for high-risk or high-stakes actions.

- **ICD-10:** International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision — A medical classification system used globally for coding diagnoses and procedures.

- **IDC:** International Data Corporation — A global market intelligence and advisory firm specializing in information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology research.

- **NPI:** National Provider Identifier — A unique 10-digit identification number for healthcare providers in the United States, required by HIPAA.

- **OPA:** Open Policy Agent — An open-source policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the stack, commonly used for ABAC implementation.

- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation — An AI architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation, grounding LLM responses in retrieved enterprise data to reduce hallucinations.

- **RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control — An authorization model that assigns permissions based on user roles (e.g., "nurse," "billing specialist") rather than individual user attributes.

- **ROI:** Return on Investment — A financial metric measuring the profitability of an investment, calculated as (Net Benefit / Cost) × 100%.
