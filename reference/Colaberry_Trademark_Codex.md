ABOUT THE FRAMEWORKS

This book introduces two proprietary frameworks developed by Colaberry Inc. 
for building and maintaining agent-ready data infrastructure:

INPACT™ Framework
The six essential needs agents must satisfy to earn user trust: Instant, 
Natural, Permitted, Adaptive, Contextual, and Trusted. INPACT is a trademark 
of Colaberry Inc.

GOALS™ Framework
The five operational excellence targets for maintaining agent-ready systems: 
Governance, Observability, Accessibility, Language, and Soundness. GOALS is 
a trademark of Colaberry Inc.

These frameworks are based on analysis of 50+ successful enterprise agent 
deployments and validated through production use in Colaberry's AIXcelerator 
platform, which processes 50,000+ daily agent interactions.

## SECTION 7: BEFORE & AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Chapter Title
```
BEFORE: Chapter 2: The Five GOALS of Agent-Ready Data
AFTER:  Chapter 2: The Five GOALS™ of Agent-Ready Data
```

### Example 2: First Mention
```
BEFORE: The GOALS Framework provides five operational targets.
AFTER:  The GOALS™ Framework¹ provides five operational targets.
        
        ¹ GOALS is a trademark of Colaberry Inc...
```

### Example 3: Running Text Pattern
```
CORRECT: "The GOALS™ Framework defines five targets. These GOALS 
         targets measure operational excellence across five dimensions. 
         Each GOAL addresses a specific discipline."
         
         First mention = ™
         Subsequent mentions = no symbol
         Individual elements = no symbol

WRONG:   "The GOALS™ Framework defines five GOALS™ targets. These 
         GOALS™ targets measure GOALS™ operational excellence..."
         
         Too cluttered, unreadable
```

### Example 4: Diagram Title
```
BEFORE: Diagram 1: The GOALS Framework Overview
AFTER:  Diagram 1: The GOALS™ Framework Overview
```

### Example 5: Table Structure
```
TITLE:   Table 1: INPACT™ Needs vs. BI Requirements (use ™)

CONTENT: | INPACT Need | BI Requirement |     (no ™ in cells)
         | Instant     | Batch OK       |
         | Natural     | SQL queries    |
```

### Example 6: Combined Framework Reference
```
CORRECT: "Together, INPACT™ (requirements) and GOALS™ (operations) 
         provide the complete methodology."
         
         Both frameworks emphasized = both marked

ALSO OK: "The INPACT and GOALS frameworks work together..."
         
         Casual reference = neither marked
```
