### Post Templates

#### Template 1: Gap Spotlight (Educational)

```
[Hook] 83% of enterprises have this critical readiness gap.

[Problem] You have Tableau dashboards. Your users love them.

But AI agents can't wait for overnight batch refreshes.

[Gap] This is the "Instant" readiness gap:
→ BI systems: Batch processing, 24-hour refresh
→ Agent systems: Real-time streaming, <1 second response

[Solution] The fix isn't replacing Tableau.

It's adding Layer 2: Real-Time Data Fabric
• CDC (Change Data Capture)
• Kafka streaming
• Event processing

[Echo Example] Echo Health had 24-hour refresh cycles.

Added Debezium + Kafka in Week 2.

Result: 72 hours → 12 seconds time-to-insight.

[CTA] Measure your readiness gap: colaberry.ai/assessment

#AIAgents #DataArchitecture #AgentReadiness
```

**Engagement triggers:** Statistics, before/after, concrete example, CTA

---

#### Template 2: Trust Pattern (Technical)

```
[Hook] Your AI agent just made a $50K mistake.

[Problem] Circuit breaker would have stopped it.

[Pattern] Trust Pattern #1: Circuit Breaker

How it works:
1. Agent makes decision
2. Confidence score: 0.62 (below 0.85 threshold)
3. Circuit trips → Human review required
4. $50K claim waits for approval
5. Mistake prevented

[Code Example]
```python
if confidence < THRESHOLD:
    escalate_to_human(decision)
    circuit_open = True
```

[Echo Example] Revenue Cycle agent processes 500 claims/day.

Circuit breaker catches 23 high-risk claims (4.6%).

Human reviews prevent $127K in errors annually.

[CTA] 12 production trust patterns: colaberry.com/trust-patterns

#AIGovernance #TrustPatterns #ProductionAI
```

**Engagement triggers:** Story opening, code snippet, quantified benefit

---

#### Template 3: Day Zero Checklist (Practical)

```
[Hook] You're about to deploy your first AI agent.

Are you ready? (Spoiler: Probably not.)

[Problem] 67% of agent deployments fail in Week 1.

Not because of bad AI.

Because of missing Day Zero preparation.

[Checklist] 5 Day Zero Must-Haves:

✅ Real-time data streaming operational
✅ RBAC policies configured (not "everyone has access")
✅ Observability stack monitoring 12 metrics
✅ Rollback plan tested (not theoretical)
✅ HITL escalation workflows defined

[Echo Story] Echo had dashboards, SQL queries, BI era tools.

Week -2: Day Zero assessment revealed 23 blockers.

Fixed 18 before Day 1.

Result: Clean Week 1 launch, zero production incidents.

[CTA] Complete 50-item checklist: colaberry.com/day-zero

#DevOps #AIOperations #ProductionReadiness
```

**Engagement triggers:** Checklist format, specific numbers, prevention angle

---

#### Template 4: 90-Day Milestone (Motivational)

```
[Hook] 10 weeks ago, Echo Health had a 28/100 readiness score.

Today: 85/100. Three agents in production. 477% ROI.

[Story] Week 0: CTO Sarah Cedao staring at $2M in failed pilots.

Board gives her 90 days or they shut down AI.

[Journey]
• Week 2: Real-time data fabric operational
• Week 4: Semantic layer validating business terms
• Week 6: First agent prototype (Care Coordination)
• Week 8: Clinical Documentation in pilot
• Week 10: Three agents, 78% adoption, production

[Result] $1.23M investment. 2.4 month payback. $2.1M Q1 revenue.

[Lesson] Success wasn't better algorithms.

It was agent-ready infrastructure.

[CTA] Your 90-day roadmap: Take the assessment at colaberry.ai/assessment

#AITransformation #CaseStudy #EnterpriseAI
```

**Engagement triggers:** Transformation narrative, concrete timeline, ROI proof

---

#### Template 5: Poll/Engagement (Interactive)

```
[Question] Which readiness gap is blocking your AI agent deployment?

[Poll Options]
• Instant: Batch data, no real-time
• Natural: Users still writing SQL
• Permitted: Flat access, no RBAC
• Transparent: Black box decisions

[Context] 95% of agent pilots fail due to infrastructure gaps.

Not because LLMs don't work.

Because your data isn't agent-ready.

[Promise] Vote + comment your situation.

I'll share specific fixes for top 3 gaps tomorrow.

[CTA] Full assessment: colaberry.ai/assessment

#AgentReadiness #DataInfrastructure
```

**Engagement triggers:** Poll voting, personalized responses, promise of follow-up
