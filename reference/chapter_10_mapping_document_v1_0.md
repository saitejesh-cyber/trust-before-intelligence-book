## QUALITY STANDARDS

### TCC Compliance Requirements

- [ ] Evidence-based: All metrics from Echo canonical data (90-Day Tracker)
- [ ] Healthcare-only: All examples use Echo Health Systems
- [ ] Zero hallucinations: Every cost, timeline, metric verified
- [ ] Citations: Minimal (implementation guide, not research)
- [ ] Canonical data: All Echo metrics consistent across sources

### VERT Certification Targets

- **Verification (V):** 9.5/10 - All Echo metrics from canonical 90-Day Tracker
- **Ethics (E):** 9.0/10 - Realistic timelines, honest about challenges
- **Reliability (R):** 9.5/10 - Proven roadmap (Echo's actual journey)
- **Transparency (T):** 9.5/10 - Complete cost and effort transparency
- **Overall Target:** 9.5/10 GREEN

### Architecture of Trust Alignment

- **Pillar 1 (INPACT™):** Week-by-week INPACT™ progression tracked (28→88)
- **Pillar 2 (7-Layer Architecture):** Each layer build timeline documented
- **Pillar 3 (GOALS™):** GOALS™ operational readiness tracked (Week 8-12)
- **Integration:** Complete roadmap shows how all three pillars built together

## DEPENDENCIES & CONSTRAINTS

### Must Reference (Backward)

✅ Chapter 9: Reader completed assessment, knows their INPACT™ score  
✅ Chapters 0-8: Echo's complete journey as context  
✅ 90-Day Tracker: Echo's canonical week-by-week metrics  
✅ Legacy Chapter 3: Detailed implementation guides  

### Must Enable (Forward)

✅ Chapter 11: Deep dive into specific phases (if reader needs more detail)  
✅ Chapter 12: Scaling and optimization (Weeks 13+)  
✅ Reader action: Start Week 1 Monday morning  
✅ 90-Day Tracker: Reader downloads templates  

### Must NOT Do

❌ Deviate from Echo's canonical metrics (90-Day Tracker is source of truth)  
❌ Promise faster timelines (90 days is realistic, proven)  
❌ Hide challenges or risks (Echo had 2 yellow weeks, show them)  
❌ Oversimplify complexity (ABAC, RAG tuning, HITL are hard)  
❌ Provide generic advice (Echo-specific, reader adapts)

| **Timeline unrealistic** | Low | High | Use Echo's actual timeline (proven, validated) |
| **Cost estimates wrong** | Low | High | Extract from budget tracker CSV exactly |
| **Challenges hidden** | Medium | Medium | Show Echo's 2 yellow weeks honestly (CDC, RAG) |
| **Too detailed/overwhelming** | Medium | Low | Focus on key activities per week, not every detail |
| **Not actionable** | Low | High | Each week has clear deliverables and next steps |
| **Tracking system confusing** | Medium | Medium | Provide templates, explain each tab's purpose clearly |
